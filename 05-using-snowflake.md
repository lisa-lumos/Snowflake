# 5. Using Snowflake
Using Snowsight, you can:
- build and run queries
- manage objects
- use the sf marketplace

## Snowsight
### Worksheets Tab
- create, view, rename, duplicate and manage worksheets
- search worksheets/dashboards
- create folders (folder's role affects all worksheets in it)
- import sql into worksheets from file
- share worksheets/folders with other users in the account (they can view/run)

With a worksheet, you can: 
- edit and run query, view, filter results and its statistics
- choose current database and schema (context/namespace)
- choose role and warehouse for this worksheet, resume and resize warehouses
- view previous versions of this worksheet
- download, and share query results to other users that has the same role with this worksheet
- see query details
- view database objects, place their names in the worksheet
- add columns of view/table into worksheets
- view object definition

Results for queries executed in worksheets are cached for up to 1 year. This cache is included in the data storage usage for your account.

Custom filters let you change the results of a query or visualization without directly editing the query. An account admin must grant each role (including itself) the permission to create custom filters.
