# 5. Using Snowflake
Using Snowsight, you can:
- build and run queries
- manage objects
- use the sf marketplace

## Snowsight
### Worksheets Tab
- create, view, rename, duplicate and manage worksheets
- search worksheets/dashboards
- create folders (folder's role affects all worksheets in it)
- import sql into worksheets from file
- share worksheets/folders with other users in the account (they can view/run)

With a worksheet, you can: 
- edit and run query, view, filter results and its statistics
- choose current database and schema (context/namespace)
- choose role and warehouse for this worksheet, resume and resize warehouses
- view previous versions of this worksheet
- download, and share query results to other users that has the same role with this worksheet
- see & visualize query details, download charts
- view database objects, place their names in the worksheet
- add columns of view/table into worksheets
- view object definition

Results for queries executed in worksheets are cached for up to 1 year. This cache is included in the data storage usage for your account.

Custom filters let you change the results of a query or visualization without directly editing the query. An account admin must grant each role (including itself) the permission to create custom filters.

### Dashboards Tab
Dashboards are flexible collections of charts arranged as tiles. The charts are generated by query results and can be customized.

Here, you can:
- Create new empty dashboard, or from existing worksheets from worksheets tab
- Rename, remove, duplicate a dashboard
- Add chart/table tile to a dashboard; edit tile query; duplicate, un-place, delete, rearrange tiles. 
- filter the dashboard
- set roles and warehouses for the dashboard queries
- share a dashboard to users
- run dashboard queries
