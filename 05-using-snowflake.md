# 5. Using Snowflake
Using Snowsight, you can:
- build and run queries
- manage objects
- use the sf marketplace

## Snowsight
### Worksheets Tab
- create, view, rename, duplicate and manage worksheets
- search worksheets/dashboards
- create folders (folder's role affects all worksheets in it)
- import sql into worksheets from file
- share worksheets/folders with other users in the account (they can view/run)

With a worksheet, you can: 
- edit and run query, view, filter results and its statistics
- choose current database and schema (context/namespace)
- choose role and warehouse for this worksheet, resume and resize warehouses
- view previous versions of this worksheet
- download, and share query results to other users that has the same role with this worksheet
- see & visualize query details, download charts
- view database objects, place their names in the worksheet
- add columns of view/table into worksheets
- view object definition

Results for queries executed in worksheets are cached for up to 1 year. This cache is included in the data storage usage for your account.

Custom filters let you change the results of a query or visualization without directly editing the query. An account admin must grant each role (including itself) the permission to create custom filters.

### Dashboards Tab
Dashboards are flexible collections of charts arranged as tiles. The charts are generated by query results and can be customized.

Here, you can:
- Create new empty dashboard, or from existing worksheets from worksheets tab
- Rename, remove, duplicate a dashboard
- Add chart/table tile to a dashboard; edit tile query; duplicate, un-place, delete, rearrange tiles. 
- filter the dashboard
- set roles and warehouses for the dashboard queries
- share a dashboard to users
- run dashboard queries

### Data Tab
The Databases area includes the following pages to drill down: Database, Schema, Table, View, Stage, Pipe, Stream, Task, Function, Procedure Details. 

Database Details page: edit db name, clone, drop db, transfer ownership of db, enable replication of db to another account. Create schema in this db. View, grant and revoke privileges on the db. 

Schema Details page: edit schema name, clone, drop, transfer ownership of schema. Create objects in schema, and opens its template sql in a worksheet. View, grant and revoke privileges on the schema. 

Table Details page: view columns, data preview, copy history of both manual and pipe loads. edit table name, clone, drop, transfer ownership of table. View, grant and revoke privileges on the schema. See table definition. View, grant and revoke privileges on the table. 

View/Stage/Pipe/Stream/Task/... Details page: similar to above. 

Private Sharing area: view inbound and outbound shares. Review share requests, manage data exchanges. Manage reader accounts. 

### Activity Tab
Shows Query history of past 14 days, copy history and task history. 

Query profile show the query execution plan, which help with spotting mistakes in sql query and identifying performance improvement opportunities. A common mistake is to use UNION when the UNION ALL semantics are sufficient. UNION ALL simply concatenates inputs, while UNION also performs duplicate elimination.

Copy history page shows data loading activity happened over the last year, for all tables. It includes bulk data loading, and continuous loading with snowpipe. 

Task history page shows the execution history of all tasks. 

### Admin Tab
The Admin tab can: 
- show snowflake usage (compute credits, storage in bytes, data transfer bytes; requires a warehouse to view these)
- manage warehouses
- setup and view resource monitors
- create and manage users & roles, grant privileges
- manage network policies and session activity
- setup payment method, accept Anaconda Python packages and SF marketplace terms. 
- set email addresses to receive security, privacy, and product notifications.
- manage account in your organization
- connect with 3rd party partner tools/services

## Help & Support Tab
Create support cases, view, update, escalate cases, adding users as watchers to cases. 

### Profile page in username icon
- enroll MFA (disable MFA cannot be done via clicking buttons in the UI, need account admin to run a sql command)
- verify email address to receive resource monitor email notifications
