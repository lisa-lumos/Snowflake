# 5. General Reference
## Parameters
I only listed the interesting ones. 

allow_client_mfa_caching: Specifies whether an MFA token can be saved in the client-side operating system keystore, to promote continuous, secure connectivity, without users needing to respond to an MFA prompt at the start of each connection attempt to Snowflake.

allow_id_token: Specifies whether a connection token can be saved in the client-side operating system keystore, to promote continuous, secure connectivity, without users needing to enter login credentials at the start of each connection attempt to Snowflake.

enable_unredacted_query_syntax_error: Controls whether query text is redacted if a SQL query fails due to a syntax or parsing error. Need to explicitly set it to true, to see the query text for queries that fail, due to a syntax or parsing error.

event_table: Specifies the name of the event table, for logging messages from stored procedures and UDFs, in this account.
