# Data Integration
## Snowflake Openflow
Snowflake Openflow is an integration service that connects any data source and any destination with hundreds of processors supporting structured and unstructured text, images, audio, video and sensor data.

## Apache Iceberg
Apache Iceberg tables for Snowflake combine the performance and query semantics of typical Snowflake tables with external cloud storage that you manage. They are ideal for existing data lakes that you cannot, or choose not to, store in Snowflake.
