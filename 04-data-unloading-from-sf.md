# 4. Data Unloading from Snowflake
Snowflake supports bulk export (unloading) of data from a database table into flat, delimited text files. The process is the same as the loading process, except in reverse - "copy into", then "get" command. 

Snowflake supports specifying a SELECT statement (instead of a table) in the COPY INTO command, the query results are written into one or more files (SINGLE = FALSE is default, MAX_FILE_SIZE determines maximum file size, PARTITION BY for partitioning) in the specified loc.
