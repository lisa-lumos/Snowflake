In query history, some queries do not have warehouse size, this is because they used cache, and never required a warehouse. If a client shows Go, it means this query started from SnowSight, because it was written in the Go language. If a query was initiated in the SnowSQL, it will show Python, because SnowSQL is written in python. If from Tableau, it will show JDBC. 

As to query tag, if you are from IT team, and need to debug/optimize queries, you can tag these queries using alter session, and put ticket/Jira number in it, so the prod department know where these additional compute cost came from.
