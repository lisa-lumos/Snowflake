# dbt projects on Snowflake
Need Github API secret credentials for sf to connect to repo. 

Need to create a workspace, that connects to the git repo. 

You can capture logging and tracing events for a dbt project object, and for the task that runs it on a schedule.

You can push your file updates from the workspace to your repo.
