Snowflake limits the size of query text submitted through Snowflake clients to 1 MB per statement, after compression. To load data that exceeds the limit, load from data files. 

Snowflake supports preparation for the following SQL statement types:
- SELECT
- DML Commands
- SHOW \<objects\>

## SnowSQL
SnowSQL is the command line client for connecting to Snowflake to execute SQL queries and perform all DDL and DML operations, including loading data into and unloading data out of database tables.
