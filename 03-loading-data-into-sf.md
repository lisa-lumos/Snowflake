# 3. Loading data into SF

Snowflake supports following data transformations while loading it into a table:
- Column reordering
- Column omission
- Casts
- Truncating text strings that exceed the target column length

For semi-structured data (Apache Parquet, Apache Avro, and ORC files), snowflake supports auto detection of schema.
